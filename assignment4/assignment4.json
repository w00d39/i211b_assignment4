The result indicates whether there is a significant difference between these two related samples.\n- **Individual t-tests:** These tests compare the means of FGM and FGA to a specified value (in this case, 0). The extremely small p-values indicate that the means of FGM and FGA are significantly different from 0, which is expected as these values should be positive.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe extremely low p-values and high t-statistics are expected given the large sample size and the nature of the data. The results indicate that there is a significant difference between the number of field goals made and attempted. The descriptive statistics provide insights into the distribution of these values, and the t-tests confirm the significance of the observed differences. The extremely small p-values are a result of the large sample size and the nature of the data, indicating highly significant results.",

The result indicates whether there is a significant difference between these two related samples.\n- **Individual t-tests:** These tests compare the means of FGM and FGA to a specified value (in this case, 0). The extremely small p-values indicate that the means of FGM and FGA are significantly different from 0, which is expected as these values should be positive.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe extremely low p-values and high t-statistics are expected given the large sample size and the nature of the data. The results indicate that there is a significant difference between the number of field goals made and attempted. The descriptive statistics provide insights into the distribution of these values, and the t-tests confirm the significance of the observed differences. The extremely small p-values are a result of the large sample size and the nature of the data, indicating highly significant results."
